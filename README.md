# 🚨 Crime Classification with Random Forest

## 📌 Objective
To build a supervised learning model that classifies crime types based on categorical and location-based features.

---

## 📊 Goals
- Clean and preprocess real-world police data
- Engineer relevant features (e.g. location, time, category)
- Train and evaluate a **Random Forest classifier**

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV Dataset (San Francisco Crime Data or equivalent)

---

## ✅ Model Results
- Accuracy: 80.77%
- AUC-ROC: 0.85
- Precision (class 1): 0.53
